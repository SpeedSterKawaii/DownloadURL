# DownloadURL

Download URL and Replace_ALL.

This basically downloads a url.
How to activate/download it?

Type this ANYWHERE in your code.

DownloadURL("https://cdn.wearedevs.net/scripts/Dex%20Explorer%20V2.txt"); // Downloads a Website (RAW TEXT).

You can also make it display text via download url.

std::cout << DownloadURL("whatever link make sure its raw"); // Probably needs fixing with errors idfk.

Anyway, enjoy the Download URL Code (make sure to make a new header plus plus file and paste it there).
